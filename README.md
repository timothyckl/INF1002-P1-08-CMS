- No numbers, punctuation, or special characters
- Leading/trailing whitespace trimmed during parsing

#### Mark Validation
- Must be valid floating-point number
- Typical range: 0.0 to 100.0
- Supports one or two decimal places
- Validated using `strtof()` with conversion verification
- Displayed with 2 decimal places in output

### File Format Details

**Separator:** Tab character (`\t`)
- **NOT** comma-separated (CSV)
- **NOT** space-separated
- Must be tab character between fields

**Metadata Header:**
```
Database Name: <name>
Authors: <author1>, <author2>, ...
```
- Required at file start
- One blank line after metadata
- Authors can be comma-separated list

**Table Header:**
```
Table Name: <name>
ID	Name	Programme	Mark
```
- Column names tab-separated
- Must match exactly (case-sensitive)

**Data Rows:**
- One row per student record
- Tab-separated fields
- No quotes around text fields
- Empty lines ignored during parsing

### Creating Custom Database Files

To create your own database file:

1. Start with metadata header
2. Add blank line
3. Add table header with column names
4. Add data rows (tab-separated)
5. Save as `.txt` file

**Template:**
```
Database Name: Your-Database-Name
Authors: Your Name

Table Name: StudentRecords
ID	Name	Programme	Mark
2501000	Student Name	Programme Name	85.50
```

**Important:**
- Use actual tab characters (not spaces)
- Follow validation rules strictly
- Invalid records will be skipped during OPEN
- System displays parse/validation error counts

### Memory Management Strategy

#### Dynamic Arrays

**Tables (Database Level):**
- Initial capacity: 2 tables
- Growth strategy: Doubles capacity when full
- Allocation: `malloc()` for initial, `realloc()` for growth
- Storage: Array of `Table*` pointers

**Records (Table Level):**
- Initial capacity: 10 records
- Growth strategy: Doubles capacity when full
- Allocation: `malloc()` for initial, `realloc()` for growth
- Storage: Array of `Record` structures

**Event Log:**
- Initial capacity: 50 entries
- Growth strategy: Doubles capacity when full
- Maximum capacity: 1000 entries (circular overflow)
- Allocation: `malloc()` for initial, `realloc()` for growth
- Circular behaviour: Overwrites oldest when exceeding max

#### Allocation Strategy

**Robust Error Handling:**
```c
new_array = realloc(old_array, new_capacity * sizeof(Type));
if (new_array == NULL) {
    // handle allocation failure
    // preserve old_array (not freed yet)
    return error_status;
}
old_array = new_array;
```

**Key Principles:**
- Check all allocation results
- Preserve old pointer if realloc fails
- Use appropriate status codes
- Free resources on error paths

#### Deallocation

**Proper Cleanup Functions:**
- `table_free(Table* table)` - Frees record array and table structure
- `db_free(Database* db)` - Frees all tables and database structure
- `event_log_free()` - Frees event log entries and array
- Called on: EXIT, OPEN (reload), and errors

**Memory Safety:**
- NULL pointer checks before operations
- Explicit null termination for strings
- `memmove()` for safe array element removal
- Zeroing of deleted memory slots

#### No Memory Leaks

The system has been tested extensively for memory leaks:
- All allocated memory properly freed
- No orphaned allocations
- Proper cleanup on all exit paths
- Tested with valgrind (no leaks detected)

### Error Handling Architecture

#### Multi-Layer Validation

**1. Input Layer (Commands):**
- Empty input detection
- String length validation
- Numeric format validation (strtol/strtof)
- Range validation
- Character type validation (alphabetic check)

**2. Business Logic (Database):**
- Duplicate ID detection
- Record existence verification
- State consistency checks
- Operation precondition validation

**3. Schema Layer (Parser):**
- Field format validation
- Constraint enforcement
- Type conversion verification
- Boundary value checking

#### Status Code System

**OpStatus (Operation Level):**
```c
typedef enum {
    OP_SUCCESS,
    OP_FAILURE
} OpStatus;
```

**DBStatus (Database Operations):**
```c
typedef enum {
    DB_SUCCESS,
    DB_FAILURE,
    DB_NOT_LOADED,
    DB_EMPTY,
    DB_DUPLICATE,
    DB_NOT_FOUND,
    // ... additional status codes
} DBStatus;
```

**ValidationStatus (Schema):**
```c
typedef enum {
    VALID,
    INVALID_ID,
    INVALID_NAME,
    INVALID_PROGRAMME,
    INVALID_MARK,
    // ... additional validation codes
} ValidationStatus;
```

**Status Code Propagation:**
- Commands call database functions
- Database functions return status codes
- Commands interpret status and display messages
- Operation registry logs status
- User sees descriptive error message

#### Error Reporting

**Consistent Message Format:**
```c
CMS: <descriptive error message>
```

**User-Friendly Messages:**
- Specific about what went wrong
- Suggest corrective action when possible
- No technical jargon in user-facing messages
- Wait for acknowledgement (Press ENTER)

**Error Categories:**
- Input errors (validation failures)
- State errors (database not loaded)
- Resource errors (file not found, memory allocation)
- Logic errors (duplicate ID, record not found)

### Key Algorithms

#### CRC32 Checksum

**Implementation:**
- 32-bit cyclic redundancy check
- 256-entry lookup table (precomputed)
- Polynomial: 0xEDB88320 (IEEE 802.3)
- Processes data byte-by-byte
- Initial value: 0xFFFFFFFF
- Final XOR: 0xFFFFFFFF

**Usage:**
- Database state integrity
- File content verification
- Change detection
- Unsaved changes warning

**Performance:** O(n) where n is data size

#### Bubble Sort

**Implementation:**
- Stable sorting algorithm
- In-place (no extra array allocation)
- Comparison-based
- Adaptive (early termination if sorted)

**Complexity:**
- Best case: O(n) - already sorted
- Average case: O(n²)
- Worst case: O(n²)
- Space: O(1) - in-place

**Comparison Functions:**
- ID: Integer comparison
- Mark: Float comparison with ID tie-breaker

**Choice Rationale:**
- Simplicity and correctness
- Stability preserves relative order
- Adequate for small to medium datasets
- In-place (minimal memory overhead)

### Design Decisions

#### Circular Event Log Buffer

**Rationale:**
- Bounded memory usage (max 1000 entries)
- Automatic old entry eviction
- No manual cleanup required
- Session-scoped (lifetime = programme execution)

**Implementation:**
- Head pointer for write position
- Size counter (capped at capacity)
- Wraparound when reaching capacity
- Display sorted chronologically

#### Dynamic Array Growth

**Strategy:** Double capacity when full

**Advantages:**
- Amortised O(1) insertion
- Reduces reallocation frequency
- Minimises memory copying
- Standard practice in dynamic collections

**Trade-offs:**
- Potential over-allocation
- Memory temporarily doubled during realloc
- Acceptable for typical dataset sizes

#### Tab-Separated Format

**Rationale:**
- Simple parsing (no quote handling)
- Human-readable and editable
- Cross-platform compatible
- No escape sequence complexity
- Direct field extraction via tokenisation

**Trade-offs:**
- No tab characters allowed in data
- Less flexible than CSV
- Manual editing requires care
- Acceptable given controlled field constraints

#### Multi-Layer Validation

**Rationale:**
- Defence in depth
- Catch errors early (fail fast)
- Clear error attribution
- Maintainable (separation of concerns)

**Layers:**
1. Input syntax (parser)
2. Schema constraints (validator)
3. Business rules (database)

#### Command Dispatch Pattern

**Implementation:** Operation registry with function pointers

**Advantages:**
- Extensibility (easy to add commands)
- Separation of concerns
- Centralised logging
- Uniform precondition checking

**Structure:**
```c
typedef OpStatus (*CommandFunction)(Database*);

// Registry maps operation enum to function
CommandFunction get_command_handler(Operation op);
```
