SIT's policy on copying does not allow the students to copy source code as well as assessment solutions
from another person AI or other places. It is the students' responsibility to guarantee that their
assessment solutions are their own work. Meanwhile, the students must also ensure that their work is

receive ZERO mark.

- We fully understand and agree to the abovementioned plagiarism policy.
- We did not copy any code from others or from other places.
- We did not share our codes with others or upload to any other places for public access and will 
  not do that in the future.
- We agree that our project will receive Zero mark if there is any plagiarism detected.
- We agree that we will not disclose any information or material of the group project to others or
  upload to any other places for public access.
- We agree that we did not copy any code directly from AI generated sources
